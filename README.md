# FRAMEndeley

This extension enriches Mendeley with Thematic Analysis functionality.

FRAMEndeley extends Mendeleyâ€™s website with support for conducting Thematic Analysis in the small. This can be useful for scoping Research Questions in an iterative manner or for comparing different research articles (e.g. when writing the Related work section or discussing results).

The extension is currently under development, so we appreciate your feedback.
